# CS465

# Architecture

### Comparison of Frontend Development:
In building the full stack project, I used different approaches for frontend development. Express HTML, which is part of the Express framework, was utilized for server-side rendering of dynamic web pages. JavaScript, a powerful scripting language, played a role in enhancing user interactions and dynamic content on both the frontend and backend. Additionally, I implemented a Single-Page Application (SPA) using Angular, allowing for smoother user experiences by updating content without full-page reloads.

### Choice of NoSQL MongoDB Database:
I opted for a NoSQL MongoDB database on the backend due to its flexibility and scalability. MongoDB's document-oriented structure allows for the storage of flexible, schema-less data, which aligns well with the dynamic nature of travel-related information. This choice enables the application to handle evolving data structures efficiently.


# Functionality

### JSON vs JavaScript and Tying Frontend and Backend:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) served as a lightweight data interchange format for seamless communication between the frontend and backend. JavaScript, a crucial language in web development, facilitated the parsing and manipulation of JSON-formatted data, ensuring dynamic rendering on the user interface.

### Refactoring Code for Functionality and Efficiencies:
Throughout the project, I refactored code to enhance functionality and efficiency. This involved restructuring code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance. I also leveraged reusable UI components to minimize redundancy, making updates more manageable and contributing to overall code efficiency.


# Testing

Methods and Endpoints: I ensured that API endpoints responded correctly to various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), verifying accurate data processing and transfer between the frontend and backend.

Security Testing: Security testing was a priority, involving checks on authentication mechanisms, authorization, and data encryption. This step was crucial to identify and address vulnerabilities, ensuring a secure application.

# Reflection

This course, CS-465-H7078 Full Stack Development I, has been instrumental in my professional growth. The hands-on experience with the MEAN stack has equipped me with valuable skills in frontend and backend technologies, database management, and security implementation. I now feel confident in designing and implementing full-stack web applications, making me a more marketable candidate in the field of web development. The ability to contribute to the entire software development lifecycle has been a significant outcome of this course.
